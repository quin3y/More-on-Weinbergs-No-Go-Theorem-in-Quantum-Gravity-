This fact appears especially mysterious if it is assumed, as is probable, that the universe underwent several phase transitions which greatly change the cosmological constant. In the standard model of particle physics, spontaneous symmetry breaking naturally leads us to expect a cosmological constant of order E4 where E is the energy scale of symmetry breaking. This energy scale ranges from (100M eV )4 for the QCD deconfinement phase transition to (1018GeV )4 for symmetry breaking at the Planck scale. Each phase transition yields a huge value of the cosmological constant, but the last phase transition must produce a very tiny cosmological constant to very high accuracy. </div>

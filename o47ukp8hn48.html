<div>at least two scenarios of accounting for this tiny value of the cosmological constant. One scenario is to appeal to some symmetry which reduces a large cosmological constant to the tiny one or zero. The difficulty with the symmetry approach is that no symmetry is known at present which can do such the job. The other is to utilize some dynamical mechanism which makes the cosmological constant relax to the tiny value. A natural candidate realizing such a scenario is that some matter field almost eats up the large cosmological constant and consequently a small fraction of it, which the matter field could not eat up, is left behind. It is this latter scenario that must confront and overcome the Weinbergâ€™s venerable no go theorem [1, 2]. </div>
